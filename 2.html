  <h2>CSS</h2>

  <p>
    CSS was designed to largely separate display presets from the content.
    If this separation is consistently carried out, only the content structure
     of a document and the meaning of its parts in HTML or XML are described,
     while CSS separately determines the presentation of the content,
     preferably in separate CSS files (e.g. B. Layout, colors and typography).
    If there were initially only simple display instructions,
    more complex modules were added over the course,
    with which e.g. B. Animations and different representations can be defined
    for different output media.
